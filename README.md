Upon launching,you'll see buttons for "Difficulty Level" and "Settings." In the Settings, you can change the background color, but it won't impact the game since it uses an image background. Clicking "Difficulty Level" gives you options for "Easy" and "Hard." In Easy mode, grab fruits to up your score, but watch out for walls â€“ hit them, and it's game over.

In Hard mode, stones and icons show up. Hitting stones ends the game, and hitting icons doubles your snake's speed. At the bottom, there's a panel for pausing, resuming, restarting, or going back to the main menu.

This engaging Snake Game combines classic gameplay with interactive features, providing players with a challenging and entertaining experience.
